### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Although jQuery uses shortcuts that may seem like a different language, it follows JavaScript rules.
2. jQuery methods can be used to traverse and manipulate the DOM and add animation effects.
3. In order for jQuery methods to be implemented the .js file must be linked to the html document in the <body> tag.
